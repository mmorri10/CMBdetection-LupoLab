DESCRIPTION: 
The algorithm intiates with a Fast Radial Symmetry Transform to detect all putative CMB candidates.  ....
........

FORMAT(s): compiled MATLAB executable file 

INPUT: The algorithm accepts a single, non-projected volumetric T2*-weighted or SWI dataset in NIFTI format (.nii). 

USAGE: Run the compiler.
       Window will pop up with..
       Results with be automatically generated in ...

TEST SET: The test set includes 10 brain tumor dataset with radiotherapy-induced cerebral microbleed. Five were acquired on a 3T GE system (P01-P05), the other 5 were acquired on a 7T GE system (P06-P10).
