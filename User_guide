DESCRIPTION: 

The algorithm intiates with a Fast Radial Symmetry Transform to detect all putative CMB candidates ....
........

FORMAT(s): 1) compiled MATLAB executable file 
           2) .m script file; MATLAB Version R2017b

INPUT: The algorithm accepts a single, non-projected volumetric T2*-weighted or SWI dataset. 

USAGE: Run the compiler.
       Window will pop up with..
       Results with be automatically generated in ...

TEST SET: The test set includes 10 brain tumor dataset with radiotherapy-induced cerebral microbleed. Five were acquired on a 3T GE system (P01-P05), the other 5 were acquired on a 7T GE system (P06-P10).
